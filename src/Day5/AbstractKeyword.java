/*Notes
--An abstract class is a class that cannot be instantiated (i.e., you cannot create an object of it).
--It may contain abstract methods (methods without a body) and non-abstract methods (regular methods with a body).
--It serves as a base class for other classes to extend and implement the abstract methods. 
--An abstract method has no body, only a method signature.
--It must be overridden in the subclass.
--If a class has even one abstract method, the class must be declared abstract.
--Abstract methods are like a contract â€” subclasses must provide the implementation.
--Abstract classes can have constructors, fields, and concrete methods.
--You must override all abstract methods in a non-abstract subclass.
